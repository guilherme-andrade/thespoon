<h3 class="mb-5">Hi, welcome to 💖<em>my preshous restaurants</em> 💖, where you find Smeagol's favorite restaurants 🐟🍗🥂</h3>
<hr>

<p class="mb-3">Just like yesterday, the goal today will be to <u>answer the following set of questions:</u></p>
<ol>
  <li class="mb-4">
    <strong>Apart from Restaurant CRUD</strong>, what <strong>other actions</strong> can a user take on this application?
    Think of <strong>User Stories</strong>.<br>
    <small class="text-muted">(CRUD actions are Create (C), List (R), See one (R), Update (U) and Delete (D))</small>
  </li>
  <li class="mb-4">
    What <strong>Models</strong> does this application have and what are their <strong>attributes</strong>.
  </li>
  <li class="mb-4">
    What <strong>Routes</strong> will we need to make our User Stories functional?
    <ul>
      <li>VERB</li>
      <li>PATH</li>
      <li>CONTROLLER</li>
      <li>ACTION</li>
      <li>NAME <small class="text-muted">(this refers to the <code>as: :&lt;route-name&#62;</code> field that generates the <code>&lt;route-name&#62;_path</code> route helper)</small></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Come up with at least one <strong>Back-End</strong> improvement for the application.</li>
</ol>
